# Logistic Regression Classifier

This project demonstrates how to use **Logistic Regression** for binary classification on a breast cancer diagnosis dataset using **Scikit-learn**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Classify tumors as **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)** using diagnostic features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue samples.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**, consisting of:
- 30 numerical features (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter)
- Target column: `diagnosis` (M = malignant, B = benign)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧰 Features
- Logistic Regression model
- Feature standardization
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- ROC curve and AUC score
- Threshold tuning
- Sigmoid function visualization
- PCA-based classification plot with decision boundary
